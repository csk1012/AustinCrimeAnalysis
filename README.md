# Inspiration
Based on the time, location, place, etc. of report can the police actually guess the severity
of a crime and with this can they react faster to 911 calls or prevent crimes as such?<br/>
Can we find a pattern of crime happening in a particular region and can this insight help us prevent/reduce 
the probablity of future crimes?
